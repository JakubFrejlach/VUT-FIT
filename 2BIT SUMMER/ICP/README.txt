Brief:
Program loads chess notation and plays them. User can also play his
own game by interrupting replay of the notation. Whole program is
controlled from GUI.

Manual:
Notation is required to load by using "Load" button.
If notation is successfully loaded, the game is ready for replay.
Hit button "Start" to begin replaying the game. You can adjust replay speed
by using horizontal slider. Speed can be set anywhere between 0 and 4 seconds.
Anytime while replaying you can hit button "Stop" to pause replay.
While replay is paused, you can manually replay notation using buttons "Next" and "Prev".
Also by clicking on any move in notation tab while auto replay is paused, the game
will move to the state after selected move was performed.
When auto replay is on pause, you can also hit "Play" button for manual playing.
All moves in notation after state the game is currently in will be discarded and
you can play your own game. Selecting figure will highlight all moves you can
perform. Performing move will also generate its notation and add it to the move
table. 


Program doesn't support:
-redo button (due to lack of time)
-multiple tabs games (due to lack of time)
-saving notation to file (due to lack of time)
